### Code Explanation

I have decided to explain the code from 0 - 100% as I'd like complete beginners to have a go with this project. ;) 


----

### Imports

So proceeding from the first line i have imported some modules i am going to use

### Colour Usage 

The next section is creating the class for the banner and or other text.
 
 
Simply use the `defined` code after the `variable` to use that color

Each code : color can be viewed <a href="">HERE</a>


### The Menu

Here you will type your tools name and than allign it accordingly


### The Structure


This is a section of the code


<img src="./images/structure.jpg">


Here the user is prompted to type the `number` of the `Tool` they wish to use

If the user chooses `option 1` the program will launch the first tool

All that `elif` means is `but if`.  Putting that definition easier will be , if the user presses 1 do this but if the user presses 2 do this.


### Your Tool

<img src="./images/the code.jpg">

What you need to `ALWAYS` include is the `elif opt == n:` where n is the next number in the code.

For example as of today (21/02/2022) the there are `8` tools 

so the next tool will start off with `elif opt == 9:` and after this it is mandatory you add these right below this line: `os.system('cls')` `print(banner)` `print("")`.
After the last `print("")` statement `import` any `modules` required for that code even if they have already been imported in the other options.

So the `structure` is now going to look like this:
